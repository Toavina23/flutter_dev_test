# flutter_dev_test

A Flutter project for testing purposes.  
It follows the clean architecture project structure and can be used as a template/model for a real world mobile application.

## Features
- Infinite scroll
- Image loading skeletons
- Item filtering by title

## Running the application
For simplicity, I have included a .env file in the repository, 
which would not be a goog practice in a real world application.

To run the application run the following command in your cli or just use you IDE.
>flutter run

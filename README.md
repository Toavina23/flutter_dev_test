# flutter_dev_test

A new Flutter project.

## Features
- Infinite scroll
- Image loading skeletons
- Item filtering by title
- 
## Running the application
For simplicity, I have included a .env file in the repository, 
which would not be a goog practice in a real world application.

To run the application run the following command in your cli or just use you IDE.
>flutter run
